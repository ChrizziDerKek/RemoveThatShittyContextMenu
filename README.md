## Usage
Run the program and wait until it's finished. It's that simple!

If you for some reason change your mind and want to re-enable the windows 11 context menu, you can run the program again and it will restore the changes!
## How it works
Because windows 11 was lazy as hell, it still contains most of windows 10's features. If you create a certain registry key, it will stop showing you the stupid windows 11 context menu and show the good old one instead. They could have included this in the settings but it's way better to force everyone to use the new "better" menu am I right?
